Before you start coding, read Chapter 2 of the xv6 book, and Sections 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter 4, and related source files:
- The user-space code for systems calls is in user/user.h and user/usys.pl.
- The kernel-space code is kernel/syscall.h, kernel/syscall.c.
- The process-related code is kernel/proc.h and kernel/proc.c.
